In this Project, I was examining my hypothesis that Real Options are a non-salient source of value for companies and that the market systematically fails to price in their future impact. 

To do so I first came up with a proxy measure of Real Options, which is referred to as Sorting Volatility. This Proxy is made up of Cash Flow Volatility as a measure of Real Options Volatility as well as Competitive Advantage as a proxy for the Real Options time to expiration, which is measured by the amount of Intangible Assets and Gross Margin standardized by industry. Out of this, a Sorting Variable is constructed from which Quintiles are created. Returns for each quintile are then calculated once assuming equal-weighted and then value-weighted portfolios. 

The timeframes examined are as follows:
Full Sample: 1981-07 - 2012-12
Pre-2000: 1981-07 - 1999-12
Post-2000: 2000-01 - 2012-12
Extended Period: 2013-01 - 2022-12

Finally, Regressions against the CAPM model, as well as the Fama-French 3 Factor Model, are performed for each time frame to find if there are any statistically significant alphas. 

The results show that there are significant alphas in both CAPM and FF3 Regressions when using equal-weighted portfolios. However, there was no statistical significance when assuming value-weighted portfolios.
